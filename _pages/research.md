I have broad interests in climate research, including Arctic-lower latitude linkage, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, ocean-atmosphere interaction, and weather-climate interface. My work is supported by expertise in Earth System Modeling, particularly high-resolution modeling. Below are examples of my research areas.

    <strong>Polar-amplification-Model-Intercomparison Project (PAMIP)</strong><br>
    One of my primary research interests is the Arctic, specifically the impact of future sea ice loss on the global climate system. I have been deeply involved in the PAMIP, which aims to understand the causes and consequences of polar amplification. We have conducted various modeling experiments to address questions including,
