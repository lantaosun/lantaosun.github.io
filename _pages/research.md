I have broad interests in climate research, including Arctic-lower latitude linkage, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, ocean-atmosphere interaction, and weather-climate interface. My work is supported by expertise in Earth System Modeling, particularly high-resolution modeling. Below are examples of my research areas.
