I am a research scientist in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University](https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/), specializing in Earth System modeling and climate dynamics, with a focus on Arctic and stratospheric processes. I have led projects utilizing the [Community Earth System Model (CESM)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/) to investigate climate responses to future Arctic sea ice loss, contributing to CMIP6 [Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/cmip6/pamip). Additionally, my work covers high-resolution modeling, western boundary current ocean-atmosphere interactions, solar-climate intervention, weather-climate interface, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, and stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Please refer to [Research](https://lantaosun.github.io/research/) for more details. I also serve as an executive editor for [Climate Dynamics](https://link.springer.com/journal/382) and an associate editor for the [Journal of Climate](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/journals/journal-of-climate/).
