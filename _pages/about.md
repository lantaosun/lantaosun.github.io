I am a research scientist in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University](https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/), where I have led projects on Earth System modeling and contributed to climate model intercomparison initiatives. My research primarily utilizes comprehensive models, such as the [Community Earth System Model (CESM)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/), to investigate climate response to future Arctic sea ice loss. I have extensively studied various topics on the causes and consequences of polar amplification, contributing to the CMIP6 [Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/cmip6/pamip). My work also encompasses stratosphere-troposphere coupling, ocean-atmosphere interactions, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, and the weather-climate interface. In addition, I am committed to community service as an executive editor for [Climate Dynamics](https://link.springer.com/journal/382) and an associate editor for the [Journal of Climate](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/journals/journal-of-climate/).
